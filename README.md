这个项目包含《数学与泛型编程：高效编程的奥秘》的配套资源；

This project contains the source code for the Chinese edition of book _From Mathematics to Generic Programming_ by Alexander A. Stepanov & Daniel E. Rose

1. 本书预计于2025年由清华大学出版社出版。
This book is expected to be published by Tsinghua University Press in 2025.

2. 本项目为这本书描述的各种算法提供了可视化、可操作的Web app。方便您体验每种算法的运算过程。另外，当然还包含了原书的配套代码和习题答案。
This project provides a visual and operable Web app for various algorithms described in this book. It is convenient for you to experience the operation process of each algorithm. In addition, it certainly includes the supporting code and exercise answers of the original book.

3. 随着翻译过程的进行，会不断完善。
It will be continuously improved as the translation process progresses.

**若不通晓数学，便难以真正理解世间万物。** ——罗杰·培根，《大著作》 

It is impossible to know things of this world unless you know mathematics. ——Roger Bacon, Opus Majus

这是一本关于编程的书，但它有别于常见的编程书籍。书中不仅包含算法和代码，还融入了诸多数学证明，以及从古代到20世纪的许多数学发现的历史背景，力求为读者呈现更完整的知识图景。

This is a book about programming, but it is different from common programming books. The book not only contains algorithms and code, but also incorporates many mathematical proofs, as well as the historical backgrounds of many mathematical discoveries from ancient times to the 20th century, striving to present a more complete knowledge picture for readers.

更具体地说，本书聚焦于泛型编程。这是一种编程范式，它起源于上世纪80年代，并在90年代随着C++标准模板库（Standard Template Library，STL）的诞生而逐渐普及。我们可以将其定义如下：

More specifically, this book focuses on generic programming. This is a programming paradigm that originated in the 1980s and gradually became popular in the 1990s with the birth of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). We can define it as follows:

**定义 1.1**：泛型编程是一种编程范式，它关注如何设计算法和数据结构，使其在尽可能广泛的应用场景中保持高性能。

**Definition 1.1**: Generic programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on how to design algorithms and data structures so that they maintain high performance in the widest possible range of application scenarios.
